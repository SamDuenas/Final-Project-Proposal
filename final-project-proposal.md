Final Project Proposal: "Internet Mood Board"

1: For my final project, I will create a mood board project called "Internet Mood Board" which would be a pretty simple interactive webpage where the user could drag, drop, and rearrange a preset collection of images, quotes, GIFs, and links that reflect them personaly with what is already there. It will take some inspiration from some of my previous project about giving compliments and such and try to make that into a visual medium as apposed to only text like they were.

2: This will be a minimal JavaScript/HTML/CSS project, focused more on design and interaction than on a depper amount functionality. The theme could be a lot of different aesthetics so I will try to incude a varying amount of images and etc that could be used in a lot of different way. I hope to be able to implement the drag and drop functioanlity but if it doesn't pan out I plan to have the images become highlighted when clicked on.
